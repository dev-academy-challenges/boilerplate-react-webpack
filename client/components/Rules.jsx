      <h1> The Ten Commandments of Rules<h1>
       <strong><p>Rule No1:</p></strong><p>Do the opposite of always, to obey a rule is a choice. To disobey a rule is to choose to deal with the consequences of doing so</p>
       <strong><p>Rule No2:</p></strong><p>Question, everything. It’s more important to understand the purpose of a rule than it is to follow it.</p>
       <strong><p>Rule No3:</p></strong><p>Ignore, can't, don't, shouldn't and must not. The same people who are today telling you, you can't are usually the same one who say I should have.</p>
       <strong><p>Rule No4:</p></strong><p> Eat your veggies, clean up after yourself and do your dishes.</p>
       <strong><p>Rule No5:</p></strong><p> Rules are open to interpretation and are instructions — a guide to help you accomplish something. But they’re not the only way to accomplish that thing.</p>
       <strong><p>Rule No6:</p></strong><p> Believe it or not, "honesty" is disobidence.</p>
       <strong><p>Rule No7:</p></strong><p> Rules are not static — they evolve. But that evolution is driven by rule breakers. </p>
       <strong><p>Rule No8:</p></strong><p> Rules aren’t facts. They’re not laws. They’re theories</p>
       <strong><p>Rule No9:</p></strong><p> Eat your veggies, clean up after yourself and do your dishes.</p>
       <strong><p>Rule No10:</p></strong><p>Number 10, the golden rule. Break all the god damn rules.</p>

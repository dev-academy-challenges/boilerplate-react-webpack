      <h1>The Ten Commandments of Rules</h1>
      <p>#1 <strong>Rule</strong> Do the opposite of always, to obey a rule is a choice. To disobey a rule is to choose to deal with the consequences of doing so</p>
      <p>#2 <strong>Rulez</strong> Question, everything. It’s more important to understand the purpose of a rule than it is to follow it.</p>
      <p>#3 <strong>Rules</strong> Ignore, can't, don't, shouldn't and must not. The same people who are today telling you, you can't are usually the same one who say I should have.</p>
      <p>#4 <strong>And more frickin rules</strong> Eat your veggies, clean up after yourself and do your dishes.</p>
      <p>#5 <strong>Rule No5:</strong> Rules are open to interpretation and are instructions — a guide to help you accomplish something. But they’re not the only way to accomplish that thing.</p>
      <p>#6<strong>Rule No6:</strong> Believe it or not, "honesty" is disobidence.</p>
      <p>#7<strong>Rule No7:</strong> Rules are not static — they evolve. But that evolution is driven by rule breakers. </p>
      <p>#8<strong>Rule No8:</strong> Rules aren’t facts. They’re not laws. They’re theories</p>
      <p>#9<strong>Rule No9:</strong> Eat your veggies, clean up after yourself and do your dishes.</p>
      <p>#10<strong>Rule No10:</strong> The golden rule, Break all the god damn rules.</p>

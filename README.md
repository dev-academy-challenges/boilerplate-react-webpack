# A starter webpack project for React

This is a starter project that uses webpack to transpile and bundle ES6 React code. To use, consider these steps:

* Fork this repo
* Rename your repo according to the app you're building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-account]/[your-app].git
cd [your-app] && npm i
```

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`. The assets built by webpack are placed in `server/public`. This folder is defined as a static folder in an Express.js server that can be started with `npm run server`.

Additional components should be placed in `client/components`.

## Separate client/server

The boilerplate is also set up to host the client using `webpack-dev-server` with hot module reloading etc. To use this method, in one terminal run:
```sh
npm run client
```
and in the other:
```sh
npm run server
```
The client will be available on http://localhost:8080 and the server on http://localhost:3000. Note that you will still need to manage CORS between the two, as they are on different ports.
